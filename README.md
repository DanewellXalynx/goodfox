Goodfox user.js is a file to harden the popular browser Mozilla Firefox, though this is still under development.
This project uses the GPLv3 license which means this project is open-source! yay!

This project also borrows features from the arkenfox/user.js and the Narsil/user.js projects!

Commits would be nice
